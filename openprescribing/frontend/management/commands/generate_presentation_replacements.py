"""This command deals with the fact that the NHS mutates its
prescribing identifiers periodically, making tracking changes through
time very difficult.

As of 2017 (but this is expected to change within the next year), NHS
England uses a derivative of the BNF (British National Formulary)
codes to identify each presentation dispensed, called the NHS Pseudo
Classification.

Unfortunately, both the BNF and the NHS make changes to codes
periodically. Sometimes a chemical gets a new code, or sometimes it
moves to a new section. Because the BNF code includes the section in
the first few characters of the code, just reclassifying a drug means
its unique identifier has changed.  This makes tracking that drug
through time impossible.

The situation is further complicated that the BNF no longer maintains
its old classification, so the Pseudo codes now used by the NHS no
longer necessarily correspond with official BNF codes at all.

The situation is expected to improve with the introduction of ePACT2
and the moving of prescribing data to use SNOMED codes as per dm+d.

For the being, this method aims to normalise all codes in our dataset
so that prescribing is always indexed by the most recent version of
the Pseudo BNF Code.

We achieve this by applying a mapping of old code to new code which
has been applied annualy by NHSBSA to create their Pseduo code list.
This mapping has been supplied to us in private correspondence with
the NHS BSA, and is reproduced (with some corrections to obvious
typos, etc) in the files accompanying this module.

The normalisation process is as follows:

For each old code -> new code mapping, in reverse order of date
(i.e. starting with the most recent mappings):

* If the code is at the section, paragraph, chemical or product level,
  mark our internal corresponding model for that classification as no
  longer current

* Find every presentation matching the new code (or classification),
  and ensure a presentation exists matching the old code.  Create a
  reference to the new presentation code from the old one.

* Create a table of mappings from old codes to the most recent current
  code (taking into account multlple code changes)

* Create a View in bigquery that joins with this table to produce a
  version of the prescribing data with only the most current BNF
  codes; this is used to generate our local version of the prescribing
  data, our measures, and so on, henceforward.  Specifically, due to
  limitations of BigQuery, there are two views:

  * `embdatalab:hscic.normalised_prescribing_legacy`: to be queried
    using BigQuery legacy SQL
  * `embdatalab:hscic.normalised_prescribing_standard`: to be queried
    using BigQuery standard SQL

* Replace all the codes that have new normalised versions in all local
  version of the prescribing data.  (If this command ever needs
  running again, some time could be saved by applying this only to
  prescribing data downloaded since the last this command was run)

* Iterate over all known BNF codes, sections, paragraphs etc, looking
  for codes which have never been prescribed, and mark these as not
  current.  This is necessary because sometimes our mappings involve a
  chemical-level change without making this explicit (i.e. a 15
  character BNF code mapping has been supplied, but in fact it's the
  Chemical part of the code that has changed).  In these cases, we
  can't tell if the Chemical is now redundant without checking to see
  if there is any other prescribing under that code.  This process
  also has the useful side effect of removing the (many thousands of)
  codes that have never actually been prescribed, and are therefore
  unhelpful noise in our user interface.

  * The problem with this approach is that recently added codes may
    not yet have prescribing, but may do so at some point in the
    future. Therefore, there is a `refresh_class_currency` method
    within the `import_hscic_prescribing` management command, which
    iterates over all sections, paragraphs, chemicals and products
    currently listed as not current, and checks to see if there has
    been any prescribing this month.

This command should in theory only have to be run once a year, as
we've been told mappings only happen this frequently.  And in theory,
2017 is the last year of using BNF codes.
