"""
Infer boundaries for practices from their locations using a Voronoi partition
(i.e. assign each point in the country to its closest practice)

These boundaries have no real meaning but they're easy enough to explain and
they allow us to render plausible-looking maps for arbitrary collections of
practices.

The boundaries are clipped at the national border to stop them extending into
the sea -- or Wales -- and generally looking ridiculous.
