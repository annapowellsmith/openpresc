"""
Defines a list of "substitution sets" which are groups of presentations which
can, in our opinion, be substituted for one another.

The most common kind of set is just a generic presentation plus all its brands,
and we use this as the starting point for defining all the substitutions.
However in some cases there are clinical reasons why brands can't be
substituted for one another so we have to remove these cases (see
EXCLUSIONS_RE).

There are also cases where distinct generic presentations *can* be substitued
for one another. For instance, a drug may come in both tablet and capsule form
and these will have distinct generic codes but they may well be interchangeable
for most purposes. We maintain a manually curated spreadsheet which lists these
kind of substitution (see FORMULATION_SWAPS_FILE).
