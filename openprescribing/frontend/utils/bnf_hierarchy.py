def _prune_paths(paths, all_paths):
    """Given two lists of paths (`paths` and `all_paths`) from the root of a tree to its
    leaves (where every path in `paths` is in `all_paths`) return a new list of
    paths from the root of the tree to either a leaf or a branch (`pruned_paths`) such
    that:

        1. every path in `all_paths` that is reachable from a path in `pruned_paths` is
            in `paths`,
        2. every path in `paths` is reachable from exactly one path in `pruned_paths`,
        3. no path in `pruned_paths` is reachable from another path in `pruned_paths`.

    These three conditions correspond to those in the docstring for simplify_bnf_codes.

    For instance:

        all_paths: [AAA, AAB, ABA, ABB, BAA, BAB, BBA, BBB]
        paths:     [AAA,      ABA, ABB, BAA, BAB,         ]

    To do this, we convert `paths` and `all_paths` into trees:

        all_paths:                  paths:

                   A                           A
                  /                           /
                 A                           A
                / \                         /
               /   B                       /
              A                           A
             / \   A                     / \   A
            /   \ /                     /   \ /
           /     B                     /     B
          /       \                   /       \
         /         B                 /         B
        o                           o
         \         A                 \         A
          \       /                   \       /
           \     A                     \     A
            \   / \                     \   / \
             \ /   B                     \ /   B
              B                           B
               \   A
                \ /
                 B
                  \
                   B

    We then prune the `paths` tree, where for each node, we remove all of the node's
    children if all of the children are in the `all_paths` tree.

    So we remove the children of AB (since ABA and ABB are in `paths`) and BA (since BAA
    and BAB are in `paths`).

    This leaves:

                   A
                  /
                 A
                /
               /
              A
             / \
            /   \
           /     B
          /
         /
        o
         \
          \
           \     A
            \   /
             \ /
              B

    Finally, we walk this pruned tree to give:

    pruned_paths: [AAA, AB, BA]

    A tree is representated as a nested dictionary.  For instance, the `paths` tree is
    represented as:

    {
        "A": {
            "A": {
                "A": {},
            },
            "B": {
                "A": {},
                "B": {}
            }
        },
        "B": {
            "A": {
                "A": {},
                "B": {}
            }
        },
    }

    And the `pruned_paths` tree:

    {
        "A": {
            "A": {
                "A": {}
            },
            "B": {}
        },
        "B": {
            "A": {}
        }
    }

    There is a test case for this example at TestPrunePaths.test_example.
