    "The NHS has <a href='https://www.longtermplan.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/nhs-long-term-plan-version-1.2.pdf'> ",
    "committed to reducing its carbon footprint by 51% by 2025</a> to meet the target in the Climate Change Act, including a shift to lower carbon inhalers",
    "to deliver a reduction of 4%.</p>",
    "<p>The 2022-2023 PCN Investment and Impact Fund (IIF) <a href='https://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/B1357-investment-and-impact-fund-2022-23-updated-guidance-march-2022.pdf'>' ",

    "Whole lifecycle carbon emissions can vary substantially between different inhaler devices</a>. Traditional metered dose inhalers (MDIs) rely on ",
    "hydrofluroalkanes (HFA) to act as a propellant to deliver doses. <a href='https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/bmjopen/9/10/e028763.full.pdf'>",
    "HFAs are potent greenhouse gases with a potency thousands of times that of carbon dioxide</a>. Dry powder inhalers (DPIs) do not contain HFA so they ",
    "consequently make up the lowest carbon options available for salbutamol, however DPIs may not be suitable for all patients. Even amongst MDIs there is ",
    "significant variation in CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent emissions with some having significantly lower HFA content."
