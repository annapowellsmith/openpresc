    "Freestyle Libre is a new continuous blood glucose monitoring system for people with diabetes, which reduces the amount of times a person may need to use a 'finger prick test'. ",
    "It is relatively expensive, and there has been some debate about its place in therapy.  Consequently CCGs originally had different funding ",
    "policies, although <a href='https://www.england.nhs.uk/publication/flash-glucose-monitoring-national-arrangements-for-funding-of-relevant-diabetes-patients/'> ",
    "in 2019 NHS England confirmed that national funding was available to offer Freestyle Libre</a> to patients who meet the clinical criteria. ",
    "In 2020 Freestyle Libre 2, an updated version of the device requiring different sensors was released.  Both types of sensor are included in this measure."
