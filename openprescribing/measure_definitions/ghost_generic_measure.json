    "When an item is prescribed generically, the dispenser is reimbursed at the price in the Drug Tariff; but when a manufacturer is stated, the reimbursement price is usually more expensive. A list of products which have been prescribed as ghost-generics is available on every CCG and Practice dashboard page. Read more in <a href='/faq/#ghostgenerics'>our FAQ</a> and <a href='https://ebmdatalab.net/ghost-branded-generics-a-new-dashboard-on-openprescribing/'>our blog</a>."
