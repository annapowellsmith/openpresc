    "In 2021-2022 there were approximately 470,000 people with diabetes receiving blood glucose strips, ketone strips, and lancets on prescription in England.  Consequently NHS England undertook a clincially-led assessment ",
    "of available products, reviewing both clinical and cost-effectiveness for patients and the NHS, and in April 2023 published <a href='https://www.england.nhs.uk/publication/commissioning-recommendations-blood-glucose-and-ketone-meters-testing-strips-and-lancets/'>",
    "commissioning guidelines, recommending specific meters, test strips and lancets.</a>  This measure relates to the recommended blood glucose testing strips.</p>",
    "<b>Please note:</b> OpenPrescribing.net measures also have a consistent way of visualising measures, where 'lower is better', and therefore in this case we show the proportion of prescriptions for strips ",
    "which are NOT in the NHS commissioning recommendations.</p>"
