Django's built-in GeoJSON serializer (django.core.serializers.geojson) will
only serialize fields defined on the model, so if you want to include results
calculated on a QuerySet using e.g. `annotate` or `aggregate` then you're out
of luck.

Below is a dirt-simple implementation of a GeoJSON serializer which accepts
dictionaries with arbitrary keys.
