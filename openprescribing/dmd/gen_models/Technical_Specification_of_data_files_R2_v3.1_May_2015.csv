1,Introduction
,This document identifies the technical specifications of the data files for
,distributing the information contained in release 2 of the Dictionary of
,Medicines and Devices (dm+d).
,"It will describe the form and the format of the files, how they can be accessed"
,and how they need to be processed in order to create a useable database and
,ensure data integrity.
2,dm+d Release 2 Database Structure
,The dm+d release 2 database consists of five major concept areas and a
,number of ancillary support areas and is fully described in the documents
,„NHS dictionary of medicines and devices Data Model‟ and NHS Dictionary of
,Medicines and Devices Editorial Policy.

The 5 main concepts are:,,,,,,,,

-,Virtual Medicinal Product (VMP),,,,,,,
-,Actual Medicinal Product (AMP),,,,,,,
-,Virtual Medicinal Product Pack (VMPP),,,,,,,
-,Actual Medicinal Product Pack (AMPP),,,,,,,

,The cardinality on the diagram depicts:,
,-,Each VTM can have many VMP‟s associated
,-,Each VMP can be related to a single VTM
,-,Each VMP can have many AMP‟s associated
,-,Each AMP is related to a single VMP
,-,Each AMP can have many AMPP‟s associated
,-,Each AMPP is related to a single AMP
,-,Each VMP can have many VMPP‟s associated
,-,Each VMPP is related to a single VMP
,-,Each VMPP can have many AMPP‟s associated
,-,Each AMPP is related to a single VMPP
,Two extra areas have been identified to hold common data:,
,-,Ingredients (shown in the diagram as Virtual Product Ingredient and
,,Actual Product Excipient).
,-,Lookup (these are items held as codes within the model but with a
,,narrative meaning eg Virtual medicinal product prescribing status is
,,stored as 1 or 2 but these values relate to “Valid as a prescribable
,,product” and “Invalid to prescribe in NHS primary care”
,,"respectively).Other values are available, see lookup file for the"
,,complete list.
2.1,dm+d Release 2 Extract Timetable,
,Once a week a full extract of the database will be published. This will be in a,
,zipped format in order to minimise the download time. The data will be,
,available for download from TRUD (Terminology Release Update,
,Distribution). This is a service provided by the Health and Social Care,
,Information Centre.,
2.2,dm+d Release 2 Extract Files (General),
,All files extracted from the database will be in XML format (.xml) and will be,
,provided with an associated schema file (.xsd) that describes the format of the,
,XML file and can be used to validate the XML file structure.,
,There will be a total of 7 XML files and associated schemas made available as,
,per the agreed timetable.,
CDR018H 6,,

3,Extract Format,
,"Each week 7 files (and 1 further GTIN zip file, see note below) will be",
,extracted relating to the following areas of the database:,
,-,Virtual Therapeutic Moieties File (will contain all VTM‟s)
,-,Virtual Medicinal Product File (will contain all VMP‟s)
,-,Actual Medicinal Product File (will contain all AMP‟s)
,-,Virtual Medicinal Product Pack File (will contain all VMPP‟s)
,-,Actual Medicinal Product Pack File (will contain all AMPP‟s)
,-,Ingredient File (will contain all ingredients associated with active VMP‟s
,,and AMP‟s)
,-,Lookup File (will contain descriptions of all items that are held as codes
,,in the other files).
,A full description of these files is given in appendix A.,
,This set of files represents the entire data population of the dictionary at a,
,specific point in time and must be combined to give a true image of the,
,database.,
,In order to maintain referential integrity within the target database the files,
,need to be loaded in the following order:,
,i),Lookup/Ingredient
,ii),VTM
,iii),VMP
,iv),AMP/VMPP
,v),AMPP
,Within the VMPP and AMPP files there are entries relating to combination,
,packs that will require loading after the main VMPPs and AMPPs are,
,populated.,
,This order assumes that the target database is being populated from scratch,
,each time and that the structure is not significantly different to the dm+d,
,Release 2 model.,
CDR018H,,7

Please note the extract will also contain a GTIN zip file that was previously available,,
in the Supplementary Files. This is also presented as an XML file with an associated,,
schema.,,
3.1,Access to Extract,
,The XML extracts and associated schema files will be available for download,
,from the TRUD download site on a page secured by username and password.,
,A username and password will be distributed to those allowed access to the,
,files.,
3.2,Implementation Guidelines,
,The following guidelines should be noted:,
,-,No additions or deletions should be made to the data set.
,-,None of the information within the data set should be altered.
,-,In order to achieve a standard coding system the supplied SNOMED
,,CT codes should be used within suppliers‟ systems throughout the
,,prescribing and dispensing process as well as for reimbursement and
,,subsequent information provision. Any mapping to existing coding
,,systems is the responsibility of the suppliers.
4,Supplementary Files,
,In addition to the dm+d files there is a supplementary file produced that,
,provides details of BNF and ATC information relating to VMP‟s and AMP‟s.,
,This file is produced to the same timetable as the dm+d files and is also,
,presented as an XML file with associated schema file.,
,"The file, when loaded, has a dependency on the pre-existence of VMP and",
,AMP data and as such should be loaded after the main dm+d files.,
