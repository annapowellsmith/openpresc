<h2>About</h2>

<p>OpenPrescribing is one of a range of projects built by the <a href="http://ebmdatalab.net">EBM DataLab</a> to help make complex medical and scientific data more accessible and more impactful in the real world.</p>

<p>It provides a search interface onto the raw <a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/practice-level-prescribing-summary">prescribing data files</a> published by NHS Digital.</p>

<p>Phase 1 of this project leading to beta launch in Dec 2015 was funded by the <a href="http://weahsn.net">West of England Academic Health Science Network</a> (£50,000).</p>

<p>OpenPrescribing is currently funded by the National Institute for Health Research School for Primary Care Research (NIHR SPCR). The views expressed are those of the author(s) and not necessarily those of the NIHR, the NHS or the Department of Health.</p>
