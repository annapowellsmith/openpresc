<h1>Top saving opportunities for {{entity.product_name }} in {{ date|date:"F Y"}}</h1>


<p>There can be wide variation in the price paid across England for
the same presentation of a drug or appliance. Every month we calculate
the average price-per-unit (PPU) achieved by practices for each
presentation. We then work out what {{entity.cased_name }} could save
if it were prescribing alongside the best 10%. </p>
<p>Each presentation name links to a chart that shows the different
PPUs achieved across the country for all equivalent brands and
formulations.</p>

<h2>Explanatory notes</h2>

<h3>Interpretation</h3>
<p>This model assumes that if pill <strong>A1</strong> is expensive and pill <strong>A2</strong> is cheap, the perfect practice could switch to prescribing 100% of pill <strong>A2</strong>.</p>
<p>We don't identify <strong>A2</strong> on your behalf, because there may be many reasons why particular switches might not make sense (see <em>Limitations</em>, below).</p>
<p>We do, however, provide charts for each presentation which show the distribution of different PPUs for all brands that have been prescribed in a given month. This can help identify brands (or generics) to which it might make sense to switch.</p>

<h3>Method</h3>
<p>Within a single month, we calculate the average PPU achieved by each practice for each presentation (generic and branded combined). We then approximate a realistic, best-case PPU by finding the average PPU which is at the cheapest decile for that presentation.</p>

<p>We then work out what each GP Practice or CCG could save if it prescribed that presentation at the best decile.</p>

<ul>
  <li>We only consider data from a single month, because the Drug Tariff changes monthly, making price-per-dose comparisons meaningless between months</li>
  <li>We cover data from standard GP Practices only</li>
  <li>When summing total possible savings, for a given practice or CCG, we don't consider savings that they are already making</li>
  <li>We use the NIC cost rather than the actual cost for these calculations (see below)</li>
  <li>When calculating PPU, we combine all formulations (e.g. tablets and capsules) that we consider to be clinically equivalent.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Limitations</h3>
<ul>
<li>Cost-saving opportunities are calculated on the basis of <em>Net Ingredient Cost</em> (NIC). We use NIC because it excludes container payments, bulk discounting and out-of-pocket expenses. This allows our calculations to be consistent across NHS England; however, this approach will, on average, overestimate possible savings by around 7%.</li>

<li>Some theoretical switches may not be advisable due to the non-bioequivalence of different brands.  We have marked presentations with non-bioequivalence issues with a warning sign <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-warning-sign" style="color:red"></span>.  Licencing differences may also play a role.</li>

<li>This analysis is carried out against GP Practice prescribing data for NHS England, which typically has a 3 month lag to its release.  If the Department of Health has updated the Drug Tariff to reflect the cheaper list prices, then a switch may no longer be necessary to achieve savings.</li>

<li>For a full discussion of our approach, including further limitations and discussion of the issues, see our <a href="https://github.com/ebmdatalab/price-per-dose">code repository</a>.  We are also in the process of writing a paper on the subject, which we will refer to here when it's published.</li>
