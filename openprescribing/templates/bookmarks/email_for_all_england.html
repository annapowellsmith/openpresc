<h2>OpenPrescribing All England Prescribing Dashboard: Monthly Update</h2>

<p>
  <em>
    This is the first iteration of our new experimental service and we are keen
    for feedback. Please respond to this e-mail with thoughts and ideas for
    features you would like to see.
  </em>
</p>

<p>
  Each month the OpenPrescribing team process data on primary care prescribing
  across NHS England and produce a
  <a href="{{ HOST }}{% url 'all_england' %}">national prescribing dashboard</a>
  (as well as dashboards for every individual practice, SICBL, ICB and regional
  team).
</p>

<p>Below are some of this month's key numbers.</p>


<h3>Prescribing measures</h3>
<p>
  We track the distribution of prescribing behaviour across {{entity_type}}s in
  NHS England on various measures covering safety, efficacy and
  cost-effectiveness
  (<a href="{{ HOST }}{% url 'faq' %}#measureinterpret">read more about these</a>).
</p>
<p>
  If all {{ entity_type}}s across England had prescribed at least as well as
  the median {{ entity_type}} on the cost-saving measures the monthly cost
  saving in <strong>{{ date|date:"F Y" }}</strong> would have been:<br>
  <span style="font-size: 150%">£{{ measure_savings.50|sigfigs:4|intcomma }}</span>
</p>
<p>
  If they had prescribed as well as the best decile the saving would have been:<br>
  <span style="font-size: 150%">£{{ measure_savings.10|sigfigs:4|intcomma }}</span>
</p>
<p>
  <a href="{{ HOST }}{% url 'all_england' %}#perfsummary">

  </a>
</p>


<h3>Low priority prescribing</h3>
<p>
  NHS England produce a <a
    href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/medicines/items-which-should-not-be-routinely-prescribed/">list
    of products</a> considered low priority for funding by the NHS.
  The total monthly spend on such products in {{ date|date:"F Y" }} was:
  <strong>£{{ low_priority_total|sigfigs:4|intcomma }}</strong>
</p>
<p>
  If every {{ entity_type }} had prescribed low priority products at least
  as sparingly as the median {{ entity_type }} the monthly cost saving in
  <strong>{{ date|date:"F Y" }}</strong> would have been:<br>
  <span style="font-size: 150%">£{{ low_priority_savings.50|sigfigs:4|intcomma }}</span>
</p>
<p>
  If they had prescribed at the level achieved by the best decile the saving
  would have been:<br>
  <span style="font-size: 150%">£{{ low_priority_savings.10|sigfigs:4|intcomma }}</span>
</p>

<h3>PPU cost savings</h3>
<p>
  There is wide variation in the unit cost of a number of medicines
  prescribed across England, due to the way the reimbursement system is
  structured.
</p>
<p>
  We have calculated the potential monthly cost saving if every {{ entity_type }}
  achieved the unit cost obtained by the best 10%.
  In <strong>{{ date|date:"F Y" }}</strong> this was:<br>
  <span style="font-size: 150%">£{{ ppu_savings|sigfigs:4|intcomma }}</span>
</p>
<p>
  <a href="{{ HOST }}{% url 'all_england_price_per_unit' %}">
    View cost savings breakdown &rarr;
  </a>
</p>

<h3>Impact of price concessions</h3>
<p>
  We have estimated the additional spending due to price concessions
  by taking the latest available prescribing data from
  <strong>{{ ncso_spending.last_prescribing_date|date:"F Y" }}</strong>
  and projecting forwards.
  In <strong>{{ ncso_spending.month|date:"F Y" }}</strong> this amounts to:<br>
  <span style="font-size: 150%">
    £{{ ncso_spending.additional_cost|sigfigs:4|intcomma }}
  </span>
</p>
