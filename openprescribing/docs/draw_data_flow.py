"""
This script produces graphs to show how data flows through the openprescribing
app.  It reads data from the .yml files in this directory, and currently shows
tables, API endpoints, and pages.  In the future it should include BQ tables,
management commands, and data sources.  These files will need to be manuualy
kept up to date.

To use, run:

    $ python draw_data_flow.py [label, [label...]]

The full output is hard to make sense of, so you can pass labels of nodes you
are interested in.  For instance, the following command will only show API
endpoints and pages that use MeasureValue:

    $ python draw_data_flow.py tables.MeasureValue

Output is produced in a file called openp-data-flow.svg.  (This could be made
configurable.)
