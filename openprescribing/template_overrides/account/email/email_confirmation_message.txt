{% load account %}{% autoescape off %}Hello from OpenPrescribing!

We recently found out that NHSMail has been discarding all our emails as spam.

As a result, we think that when you signed up for monthly alerts about {{ user.profile.most_recent_bookmark.topic }}, you never received an email requesting that you confirm this.

So, to confirm this is correct, go to {{ activate_url }}

If you no longer want to receive alerts about prescribing behaviour, just ignore this email.
{% endautoescape %}

Thanks, and apologies for the inconvenience,

The OpenPrescribing team
