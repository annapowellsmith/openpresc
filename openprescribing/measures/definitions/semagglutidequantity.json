	"Semaglutide is a new (glucagon-like peptide-1) GLP-1 agonist, used to treat diabetes. ",
    "It comes as a pre-filled pen and is used weekly.  Each of these pens contains four doses and a single pen will last for one month",
    "However, there have been some reports that prescribers are requesting four pens per month in error.",
    "This is unlikely to be required and likely to be caused by the dose and quantity being confused on a picking list."
