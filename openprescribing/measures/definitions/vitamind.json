    "Colecalciferol (vitamin D3) is commonly prescribed, both as a combination product with calcium, and individually.</p>",
    "<p>NHS England guidance on prescribing products which are available over the counter states:",
    "NHS advice is that people at risk of vitamin D deficiency should consider taking daily supplements of vitamin D, which should be purchased from a pharmacy, supermarket or other retailer. No evidence supports taking vitamin D supplements to prevent or treat Covid-19. People with medically confirmed deficiency may be prescribed vitamin D in line with NICE guidance."
