	"Semaglutide and tirzepatide are both used mainly to treat diabetes. ",
    "Semaglutide injection is used weekly and is only available as a multidose pre-filled pen, each of which contains four doses and a single pen will last for one month. ",
	"Tirzepatide is used weekly and is licensed in both a single-use and a multidose pre-filled pen form. ",
	"The tirzepatide multidose pen contains four doses and a single pen will last for one month. ",
    "There have been some reports that prescribers are requesting four multidose pens per month in error. ",
    "This is unlikely to be required and likely to be caused by the dose and quantity being confused on a picking list."
