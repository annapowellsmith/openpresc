    "<p>It is important that we don't overuse antibiotics.  As antimicrobials underpin routine medical practice, ",
    "antimicrobial resistance poses a significant threat to public health.",
    "This measure shows the use of injectable preparations listed in the infections chapter of the British National Formulary, including ",
    "antibiotics, antivirals and antifungals.  We have excluded <a href='https://openprescribing.net/dmd/vmp/324311004/'>colistimethate ",
    "sodium</a>, as the injection is more commonly inhaled for the treatment of infections in people with cystic fibrosis.</p>",
    "<p>The prescribing of injectable preparations may vary substantially throughout the country depending on the availability of local ",
    "services such as Antibiotic Outpatient Parenteral Therapy (OPAT), where patients receive injectable antibiotics in their own home.  ",
    "Nevertheless it is important to audit and review the appropriateness of all treatments to support good antimicrobial stewardship.</p>",
