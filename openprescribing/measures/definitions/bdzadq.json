    "Anxiolytics and Hypnotics are drugs that are prescribed for short-term treatment of conditions such as",
    "anxiety and sleep problems. <a href='https://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/expertadvice/treatments/benzodiazepines.aspx'> The Royal College of Psychiatrists states</a> ",
    "that \"around 4 in every 10 people who take them every day for more than 6 weeks will become addicted\" ",
    "and therefore they should not be prescribed for longer than 4 weeks.  This measure shows the mean Average Daily Quantity (ADQ) given per prescription, ",
    "for both the older benzodiazepines, such as diazepam and temazepam, and the newer \"Z-drugs\", such as zopiclone.  It excludes items that do not have ",
