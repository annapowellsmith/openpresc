    Numpy has two classes for representing two-dimensional arrays: `matrix` and

    recommend only using `ndarray` as it's more powerful and more general than
    `matrix`. However, the only sparse representions available are of `matrix`
    type rather than `ndarray` so we're forced to still deal with the `matrix`
    type. (Though it's possible that in future there'll be a sparse `ndarray`:
    https://github.com/scipy/scipy/issues/8162)

    Our strategy is to ensure that whenever we move from a sparse to a dense
    representation we end up with an `ndarray` rather than a `matrix`.
    Fortunately, it's possible to convert between the types without having to
    modify the underlying data, so one can simultaneousy have a `matrix` and
    `ndarray` view on the same set of data in memory.
