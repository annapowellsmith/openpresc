# This file lists all the packages that openprescribing depends on directly.
# See instructions at the top of base.txt for how to generate a full list of
# pinned requirements.

# Note that most of the pinned version numbers here are not essential (they
# were taken from the versions running in production at the point that this
# file was created) and many of the `==`s could probably be safely replaced
# with `>=`s.  If there are new or upgraded dependencies which make dependency
# resolution impossible, loosening the requirements here should be the first
# thing we try.
