# Open Prescribing

Website code for https://openprescribing.net - a Django application that provides a REST API and dashboards for the NHS Digitals's [GP-level prescribing data](http://content.digital.nhs.uk/searchcatalogue?q=title%3A%22presentation+level+data%22&area=&size=10&sort=Relevance) and [NHS BSA's Detailed Prescribing Information Report](https://apps.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/infosystems/welcome). 

Information about data sources used on OpenPrescribing can be found [here](https://openprescribing.net/about/)

# Set up the application

You can install the application dependencies either on bare metal, or
using docker.

## Using docker

Install `docker` and `docker-compose` per
[the instructions](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (you need
at least Compose 1.6.0+ and Docker Engine of version 1.10.0+.)

In the project root, run

    docker-compose run test

This will pull down the relevant images, and run the tests.  In our CI
system, we also run checks against the production environment, which
you can reproduce with

    docker-compose run test-production

To open a shell (from where you can run migrations, start a server,
etc), run

    docker-compose run dev

The project code is mounted as a volume within the docker container,
at `/code/openprescribing`. Note that the container runs as the `root`
user, so any files you create from that console will be owned by
`root`.

The first time you run `docker-compose` it creates a persistent volume
for the postgres container. Therefore, if you ever need to change the
database configuration, you'll need to blow away the volume with:

    docker-compose stop
    docker-compose rm -f all

Any time you change the npm or pip dependencies, you should rebuild
the docker image used by the tests to improve runtime performance of
travis.

    # Base docker image, for production
    docker build -t ebmdatalab/openprescribing-base .
    # Same as base, but with local-only pip dependencies
    docker build -t ebmdatalab/openprescribing-test -f Dockerfile-test .
    docker login  # details in `pass`; only have to do this once on your machin
    # push the images to hub.docker.io
    docker push ebmdatalab/openprescribing-base
    docker push ebmdatalab/openprescribing-test


### Running the application from within Docker
To be able to access the django instance running inside Docker from outside the container, docker must be told to publish the port on which Django will listen:

    docker-compose run -p 8000:8000 dev

This will give a shell, at which you can start Django, specifying the ``0.0.0.0`` interface so that it will accept connections from all IP addesses (not just localhost):

     python manage.py runserver_plus 0.0.0.0:8000 --settings=openprescribing.settings.local

The application should then be accessible at ``http://localhost:8000/`` from a web-browser on the host computer.

## On bare metal

This should be enough to get a dev sandbox running; some brief notes
about production environment follow.

### Set up a virtualenv

If you're using [virtualenvwrapper](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.org/en/latest/):

    mkvirtualenv openprescribing
    cd openprescribing && add2virtualenv `pwd`
    workon openprescribing

### Install dependencies

Install library dependencies (current as of Debian Jessie):

    sudo apt-get install nodejs binutils libproj-dev gdal-bin libgeoip1 libgeos-c1 git-core vim sudo screen supervisor libpq-dev python-dev python-pip python-virtualenv python-gdal postgis emacs nginx build-essential libssl-dev libffi-dev unattended-upgrades libblas-dev liblapack-dev libatlas-base-dev gfortran libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev

Install Python dependencies in development:

    pip install -r requirements/local.txt --process-dependency-links

Or in production:

    pip install -r requirements.txt --process-dependency-links

And then install JavaScript dependencies. You'll need a version of
nodejs greater than v0.10.11:

    cd openprescribing/media/js
    npm install -g browserify
    npm install -g jshint
    npm install

To generate monthly alert emails (and run the tests for those) you'll
need a `phantomjs` binary located at `/usr/local/bin/phantomjs`. Get
it from [here](http://phantomjs.org/download.html).

### Create database and env variables

Set up a Postgres 9.4 database (required for `jsonb` type), with
PostGIS extensions, and create a superuser for the database.

    createuser -s <myuser>
    createdb -O <myuser> <dbname>
    psql -d <dbname> -c "CREATE EXTENSION postgis;"

Set the `DB_NAME`, `DB_USER`, and `DB_PASS` environment variables based on the database login you used above.

Set the `CF_API_EMAIL` and `CF_API_KEY` for Cloudflare (this is only required for automated deploys, see below).

You will need a `GMAIL_PASS` environment variable to send error emails in production. In development you will only need this to run tests, so you can set this to anything.

You will want `MAILGUN_WEBHOOK_USER` and `MAILGUN_WEBHOOK_PASS` if you want to process Mailgun webhook callbacks (see [`TRACKING.md`](./TRACKING.md)) to match the username/password configured in Mailgun. For example, if the webhook is

    http://bobby:123@openprescribing.net/anymail/mailgun/tracking/

Then set `MAILGUN_WEBHOOK_USER` to `bobby` and `MAILGUN_WEBHOOK_PASS` to `123`.

Finally set a `SECRET_KEY` environment variable (make this an SSID).

## Production notes

Keeping environment variables all in one place can be a faff. In
production, we've solved this by adding them all in
`/etc/profile.d/openprescribing.sh` and then adding `source
/etc/profile.d/openprescribing.sh` to `<virtualenv>/bin/activate`.

The script at `contrib/bin/gunicorn_start` is responsible for starting up a backend server. We proxy to this from nginx using a configuration like that at `contrib/nginx/`.  We control the gunicorn process using `supervisor`, with a script like that at `contrib/supervisor/`.

# Set up the database

Run migrations:

    python manage.py migrate

# Run tests

Run Django and JavaScript tests:

    make test

If required, you can run individual Django tests as follows:

    python manage.py test frontend.tests.test_api_views

We support IE8 and above. We have a free account for testing across
multiple browsers, thanks to [BrowserStack](www.browserstack.com).

Note that tests are run using the settings in
`openprescribing/settings/test.py`; this happens automatically

## Functional tests

Functional tests are run using Selenium; the default in your sandbox
is to do so via a Firefox driver, so you will need Firefox
installed. Running the functional tests will therefore result in a
browser being launched.

If you want to run the tests headless (i.e. without launching a
browser), you have two choices:

### Run the functional tests using Xvbf

To do this, you'll need to install
[pyvirtualdisplay](http://pyvirtualdisplay.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#installation)
and Xvbf. This is, apparently, quite hard to do on OS X.

If you don't install Xvbf, you'll see the tests launch a browser and
operate it.

You can run *just* the functional tests with

    TEST_SUITE=functional make test

And the inverse is:

    TEST_SUITE=nonfunctional make test

### Run the functional tests in Saucelabs

In our CI environment we use [Saucelabs](http://saucelabs.com) to run
the functional tests in various browsers. If you are connected to the
internet, you can run these tests against Saucelabs by
[installing Sauce Connect](https://wiki.saucelabs.com/display/DOCS/Setting+Up+Sauce+Connect),
and running:

    # Start the Sauce Connect proxy
    ./sc -u $SAUCE_USERNAME -k $SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY

    # Run the tests using Saucelabs
    USE_SAUCELABS=1 BROWSER="firefox:47:Windows 2012" make test

You can work out the browser string to use for your desired platform /
browser combination using
[this Saucelabs tool](https://wiki.saucelabs.com/display/DOCS/Platform+Configurator#/).
You can find the combinations we use for our Travis CI in
[`.travis.yml`](.travis.yml).

### Skip the functional tests

    TEST_SUITE=nonfunctional make test

# Run the application

    python manage.py runserver_plus --settings=openprescribing.settings.local

You should now have a Django application running with no data inside it.

# Load the HSCIC data

Check out the `openprescribing-data` repo (which contains data for the
app, and scripts to update that data):

    git clone git@github.com:ebmdatalab/openprescribing-data.git

Follow the documentation there to import data.

# Editing JS and CSS

Source JavaScript is in `/media`, compiled JavaScript is in `/static`.

During development, run the `watch` task to see changes appear in the compiled JavaScript.

    cd openprescribing/media/js
    npm run watch

The client-side code makes extensive use of data from the API. To test client-side code against production data, you can set an environment variable to use an API host other than the default:

    API_HOST=https://openprescribing.net npm run watch

And run tests with:

    npm run test

Before deploying, run the build task to generate minified JavaScript:

    npm run build

Similarly, you can build the compiled CSS from the source LESS with:

    npm run build-css

# Deployment

Deployment is carried out using [`fabric`](http://www.fabfile.org/).

Your public key must be added to `authorized_keys` for the `hello`
user, and SSH forwarding should work (this possibly means running
`ssh-agent add <private-key>` on your workstation - see
[this helpful debugging guide](https://developer.github.com/guides/using-ssh-agent-forwarding/)
if you are having problems.

Running `fab deploy:production` will:


* Check if there are any changes to deploy
* Install `npm` and `pip` as required (you will need sudo access to do this)
* Update the repo on the server
* Install any new pip and npm dependencies
* Build JS and CSS artefacts
* Run pending migations (only for production environment)
* Reload the server gracefully
* Clear the cloudflare cache
* Log a deploy to `deploy-log.json` in the deployment directory on the server

You can also deploy to staging:

    fab deploy:staging

Or deploy a specific branch to staging:

    fab deploy:staging,branch=my_amazing_branch

If the fabfile detects no undeployed changes, it will refuse to run. You can force it to do so (for example, to make it rebuild assets), with:

    fab deploy:production,force_build=true

Or for staging:

    fab deploy:staging,force_build=true,branch=deployment
