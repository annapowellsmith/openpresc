# Service names follow the pattern:
#
#   app.<APP_NAME>.<PROCESS_NAME>.service
#
# The "app" prefix serves to namespace our services off from any other system
# services.
#
# APP_NAME is the name of this particular deployment of an application. If a
# single project (e.g. openprescribing) is deployed in multiple environments
# (e.g. production, staging) then each environment gets its own app name.
#
# A single application may have multiple processes and hence multiple services
# wtih different PROCESS_NAMEs. By convention (established by Heroku) the
# process that runs the web application is called "web".
#
# The "service" suffix comes from systemd. Services which want systemd to
# manage a socket for them (to allow for graceful restarts) will also have a
# corresponding ".socket" configuration file to go with the ".service" file.
#
# Because many systemd commands allow the use of wildcards, this dotted-name
# convention makes it easy to do things like "restart all services for this
# app".
